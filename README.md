# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of common data structures for learning and reference purposes. Each structure is designed with clarity and simplicity in mind.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests, make sure you have `pytest` installed on your machine:

```
pip install pytest
```
(you can install it by several ways, the above is just a way of them)

### Then, run the tests with:

```
pytest
```
